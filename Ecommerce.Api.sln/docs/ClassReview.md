# Class Review and Improvement Suggestions

This document reviews every class currently present in the solution and
outlines recommended improvements to evolve the codebase beyond the
placeholder scaffolding.

| Project | Class | Current State | Recommended Improvements |
|---------|-------|---------------|---------------------------|
| `Ecommerce.Application` | `Class1` | Empty placeholder with no defined responsibility. | Rename the class to reflect a concrete use-case (e.g., `ProductService`). Add methods that orchestrate domain operations, enforce application-level validation, and return DTOs. Consider integrating mediator or CQRS patterns if the architecture calls for them. |
| `Ecommerce.Domain` | `Class1` | Empty placeholder representing domain layer. | Replace with rich domain models such as `Product`, `Order`, or `Customer`. Encapsulate business invariants, leverage value objects, and expose behaviors rather than mutable data. Employ domain events to signal important business changes. |
| `Ecommerce.Infrastructure` | `Class1` | Empty placeholder intended for infrastructure logic. | Implement repositories, data contexts, or external service gateways. Abide by clean architecture boundaries by isolating persistence and integration concerns. Ensure classes depend on abstractions defined in the application/domain layers. |

## General Recommendations

- Establish clear naming conventions to reflect responsibilities and improve maintainability.
- Add unit and integration tests once business logic is implemented to guard against regressions.
- Document public APIs with XML comments and provide usage examples in the README.
- Introduce dependency injection configuration within the API project to wire up application and infrastructure services.
- Remove placeholder classes once real implementations exist to avoid confusion.
